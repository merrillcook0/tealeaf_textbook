#"an exception was thrown" essentially means an error in your code has occured, this might be as simple as a data in the wrong format, or a method that doesn't work on a data type, but if this happens, and you don/t want your entire program to just shut down on the spot, you should throw in some exception handling such as the "rescue" method.
